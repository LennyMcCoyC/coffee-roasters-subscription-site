## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

- Accordion and selection made easier with radio button
- Mobile react state rendering
- File structuring and naming convention

### Continued development

There are still some bugs regarding styles and some react problems I haven't figured out yet. I will keep improving this site until I'm 100% happy about it!
